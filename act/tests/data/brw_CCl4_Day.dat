#  Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) data from hourly in situ samples analyzed on a gas chromatograph located
#  at Pt. Barrow (BRW), Alaska (71.3 N, 156.6 W, elevation: 8 m).
#
#  Atmospheric Measurements from the NOAA/ESRL Chromatograph for Atmospheric Trace Species
#  (CATS) Program.  This GC replaces the RITS GCs operated during the period of 1986 through 2000.
#  This work was funded in part by the Atmospheric Chemistry Project of NOAA's Climate and
#  Global Change Program.

#  Data use policy:
#  If you use this data in a publication or report, we would appreciate that you contact the principal
#  investigators (PIs) first and discuss your interests.  We are trying to encourage scientific discussion.
#  The PIs can discuss the quality of the data and any potential problems with its analysis.  Recent data (less
#  than 1.5 years) are considered preliminary.  Please contact the PIs for more information.
#
#  The data should be cited in presentations or publications as the flowing:  Carbon tetrachloride data from
#  the NOAA/ESRL halocarbons in situ program.

#  The CATS GCs sample air once an hour.  Daily median data are provided in parts-per-trillion, ppt.
#  Abbreviations used:
#  yr=year, mon=month, m=monthly data; gc=type of sample--in situ GC data, sd=standard deviation of samples,
#  n=number of samples, brw=Pt. Barrow, Alaska, sum=Summit, Greenland, nwr= Niwot Ridge, Colorado
#  mlo=Mauna Loa, Hawaii, smo = American Samoa, spo=South Pole, Antarctica
#  NAN=not a number or no data, and space(s) is the delimiter.
#
#  The standard deviation (unc) reported is the estimate of insturmental precision.
#  The standard deviation (sd) reported is the estimate of atmospheric variability.
#
#  year, month, day, daily median CCl4 in ppt, std. dev.
