    """
    This tool will help users utilize the ARM Live Data Webservice to download
    ARM data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    username : str
        The username to use for logging into the ADC archive.
    token : str
        The access token for accessing the ADC archive.
    datastream : str
        The name of the datastream to acquire.
    startdate : str
        The start date of the data to acquire. Format is YYYY-MM-DD.
    enddate : str
        The end date of the data to acquire. Format is YYYY-MM-DD.
    output : str
        The output directory for the data. Set to None to make a folder in the
        current working directory with the same name as *datastream* to place
        the files in.

    Notes
    -----
    This programmatic interface allows users to query and automate
    machine-to-machine downloads of ARM data. This tool uses a REST URL and
    specific parameters (saveData, query), user ID and access token, a
    datastream name, a start date, and an end date, and data files matching
    the criteria will be returned to the user and downloaded.

    By using this web service, users can setup cron jobs and automatically
    download data from /data/archive into their workspace. This will also
    eliminate the manual step of following a link in an email to download data.
    All other data files, which are not on the spinning
    disk (on HPSS), will have to go through the regular ordering process.
    More information about this REST API and tools can be found on `ARM Live
    <https://adc.arm.gov/armlive/#scripts>`_.

    Examples
    --------
    This code will download the netCDF files from the sgpmetE13.b1 datastream
    and place them in a directory named sgpmetE13.b1. The data from 14 Jan to
    20 Jan 2017 will be downloaded. Replace *userName* and *XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX*
    with your username and token for ARM Data Discovery. See the Notes for
    information on how to obtain a username and token.
