===========================================================
Example for working with embedded quality control variables
===========================================================

This is an example of how to use 2 dimentional DataArrays containing
multiple 1 dimentional data, including a summary quality control
plot showing the tests for each 1 dimentional data slice. This
example uses the force_line_plot keyword which will force multiple
1 dimentional plots for each element along the second dimention of
the non-time dimention.

    # Create the top plot of data using the force_line_plot option.
    # This will force the plotting to not assume the data are 2D data that
    # would normally be plotted as a 2D plot. Rather for each index into the
    # filter dimention plot a 1D time series plot. Setting labels=True
    # will create a legend using the filter dimention DataArray.
    display.plot(var_name, force_line_plot=True, labels=True)

    # Create the bottom plot of summarized quality control by assessment
    # cateory.
    display.qc_flag_block_plot(var_name, subplot_index=(1, ))

    # Show the plot in a new window.
