Correct wind data for ship motion
---------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to calculate course and speed
over ground of the ship and use it to correct the
wind speed and direction data.

    import act

    # Read in the navigation data, mainly for the lat/lon
    nav = act.io.armfiles.read_netcdf(act.tests.sample_files.EXAMPLE_NAV)

    # lat and lon data

    # Call the correction for the winds.  Note, that this only
    # corrects for ship course and speed, not roll and pitch.
