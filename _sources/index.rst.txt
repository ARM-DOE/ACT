Atmospheric Community Toolkit (ACT)
===================================
The Atmospheric data Community Toolkit (ACT) is an open source Python toolkit for working with atmospheric time-series datasets of varying dimensions.  The toolkit is meant to have functions for every part of the scientific process; discovery, IO, quality control, corrections, retrievals, visualization, and analysis.   It is meant to be a community platform for sharing code with the goal of reducing duplication of effort and better connecting the science community with programs such as the `Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) User Facility <http://www.arm.gov>`_.  Overarching development goals will be updated on a regular basis as part of the `Roadmap <https://github.com/AdamTheisen/ACT/blob/master/guides/ACT_Roadmap.pdf>`_  .

Contributing
============

ACT is an open source, community software project. Contributions to the
package are welcomed from all users.

The latest source code can be obtained with the command::

    git clone https://github.com/ARM-DOE/ACT.git

If you are planning on making changes that you would like included in ACT,
forking the repository is highly recommended.

We welcome contributions for all uses of ACT, provided the code can be
