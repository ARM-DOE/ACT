"""
Forcing line plots with 2D data and QC
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is an example of how to use 2 dimentional DataArrays containing
multiple 1 dimentional data, including a summary quality control
plot showing the tests for each 1 dimentional data slice. This
example uses the force_line_plot keyword which will force multiple
1 dimentional plots for each element along the second dimention of
the non-time dimention.
