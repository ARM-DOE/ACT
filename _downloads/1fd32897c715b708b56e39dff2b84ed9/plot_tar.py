"""
Working with TAR and gunzip files
-------------------------------------------------------------

This is an example of how to use the TAR and gunzip extensions
for creating or extracting data files. The functions for creation
and extraction can be called independently to manage the data
files directly or a TAR or gunzip file can be provided to the
netCDF reader and the extraction will happen automatically to
a temporary area.
