"""
Working with and expanding embedded quality control variables
-------------------------------------------------------------

This is an example of how to use existing or create new quality
control varibles and extend the quality control flagging. The
anicllary quality control variable can be expanded by integrating
external Data Quality Reports, adding additional generic ACT tests,
instrument specific ACT tests, or reading a configuraiton file of
known failures to clean up the data variable.
