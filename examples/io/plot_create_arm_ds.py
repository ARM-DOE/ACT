Create a dataset to mimic ARM file formats
------------------------------------------
Example shows how to create a dataset from an ARM DOD.
This will enable users to create files that mimic ARM
files, making for easier use across the community.

# Print out the xarray dataset to see that it's empty

# The user could populate this through a number of ways
# and that's best left up to the user on how to do it.
# If one has an existing dataset, a mapping of variable
# names is sometimes the easiest way

# Let's look at some variable attributes
# These can be updated and it would be up to the
# user to ensure these tests are being applied
# and are appropriately set in the cooresponding QC variable

# if they are needed using a dictionary
